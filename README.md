# Socioeconomically Equitable Housing Prices Prediction

The dataset I worked with in this project comes from the Cook County Assessor’s Office (CCAO) in Illinois, a government institution that determines property taxes across most of Chicago’s metropolitan area and its nearby suburbs. In the United States, all property owners are required to pay property taxes, which are then used to fund public services including education, road maintenance, and sanitation. These property tax assessments are based on property values estimated using statistical models that consider multiple factors, such as real estate value and construction cost.

This system, however, is not without flaws. In late 2017, a lawsuit was filed against the office of Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios for producing “racially discriminatory assessments and taxes." The lawsuit included claims that the assessor’s office undervalued high-priced homes and overvalued low-priced homes, creating a visible divide along racial lines: Wealthy homeowners, who were typically white, paid less in property taxes, whereas working-class, non-white homeowners paid more.

In this project, I construct a multillinear regression model using supervised machine learning techniques that solves this issue! Although the end result has non-negligible random error, it has extremely low systematic error. Building further on this could solve Cook County's problem.

NOTE: The files on which data modelling were done were too large to be uploaded to GitHub in full.
